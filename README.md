We propose Vacant Seat Detector, a project that finds empty seats at popular cafes. This project creates a layout of the room in bird’s eye view and produces a real-time visual depiction of table capacity and table occupancy. Through a pipeline that consists of object detection via YOLOv7, conversion of image features to and from world coordinates, and precise feature detection with k-means clustering, we produce accurate graphical output of the café. By placing a video of this information at the entrance of a café or on an online platform, businesses can provide customers an efficient method of finding appropriate cafes for their circumstances. This project also generalizes beyond cafes to any in-demand space that uses ordinary, single-color tables and involves typical illumination conditions.
